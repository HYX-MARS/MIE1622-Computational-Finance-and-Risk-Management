# MIE1622-Computational-Finance-and-Risk-Management
The goal of this course is introduce the concepts of constructions of computational algorithms for soliving financial problems, such as risk-aware decision-making, asset pricing, portfolio optimization and hedging. Considerable attention is deveoted to the application of computational and programming techniques to financial, investment and risk management problems. Jupyter notebook (Python IDE) is the primary computational and modeling software used in this course. <br>

**Assingment 1: Mean-Variance-Portfolio-Selection-Strategies** <br>
The purpose of this assignment is to compare computational investment strategies based on minimizing portfolio variance and maximizing Sharpe ratio. The classical Markowitz model is applied for the portfolio optimization. The goal of optimization effort is to create a tool that allows the user to make regular decisions about re-balancing their portfolio and compare different investment strategies. The factors require optimization includes the total return, the risk and Sharpe ratio. The following 4 strategies are tested and compared:
1. Buy and Hold strategy
2. Equally weighted portfolio strategy
3. Minimum variance portfolio strategy
4. Maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio strategy
